# Object-Oriented Programming Labs in C++

## Overview
This repository contains a series of lab exercises completed as part of a university-level Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using C++. Each lab exercise focuses on various aspects of object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. These labs serve as practical applications to reinforce theoretical concepts and enhance programming skills in C++.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Exercises:** Each lab exercise covers specific OOP concepts and techniques, gradually increasing in complexity.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Provides practical experience in implementing OOP principles through coding exercises.
- **Structured Approach:** Labs are organized sequentially, allowing learners to build upon their knowledge.
- **Clear Instructions:** Detailed instructions and requirements guide students through the implementation process.
- **Sample Solutions:** Included sample solutions offer insights into possible approaches and best practices.
- **Platform Independence:** Labs are designed to be platform-independent for flexibility in development environments.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Classes and Objects**
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
3. **Encapsulation and Access Control**
4. **Templates and Standard Template Library (STL)**
5. **Exception Handling**
6. **File Handling**
7. **Design Patterns**

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired lab exercise.
3. Follow the instructions in the README file.
4. Implement the required functionality in C++.
5. Test and verify your implementation.
6. Refer to sample solutions for comparison and insights.
